//! ErgoScript → ErgoTree compiler.
//!
//! M1 scope: source text → untyped AST, faithful to the Scala reference parser
//! (`sigmastate.lang.SigmaParser`, sigma-state 6.0.2): same accept/reject
//! decisions, same AST shapes, same error positions. Design:
//! `dev-docs/ergoscript-compiler-design.md`. Every grammar decision in this
//! crate cites the mirrored Scala source as `file:line` under
//! `sigmastate-interpreter`.
//!
//! NOT a consensus surface: a compiler bug yields a wrong tree/address, never
//! a fork — but a wrong address strands funds, so correctness is held to the
//! oracle-parity bar anyway.
