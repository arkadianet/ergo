//! Scala-compat `/emission/*` surface.
//!
//! Mirrors `EmissionApiRoute.scala` — emission-schedule data for a given
//! height. **Public by parity**: the Scala route carries no `withAuth`,
//! so nothing here goes near the `api_key` gate (regression pinned by
//! `tests/openapi_native_runtime_mount.rs`: this route must answer bare
//! requests even when security is wired).
//!
//! The schedule math itself lives in `ergo-mining::emission_rules`
//! (single source of truth, oracle-tested against the live Scala node);
//! this crate stays trait-decoupled from the engine crates, so the node
//! hands in an [`EmissionSchedule`] view built over that math.
//!
//! `GET /emission/scripts` (emission / reemission / pay2Reemission P2S
//! addresses) is **not implemented** — the contract-tree predefs aren't
//! exposed in the workspace yet. The live-Scala oracle for it is already
//! captured at `test-vectors/api/emission/scripts.json` for whoever
//! picks that up.
